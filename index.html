        <h3>African Elephants</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>The African elephant is the largest animal walking the Earth. Their herds wander through 37 countries in
            Africa. They are easily recognized by their trunk that is used for communication and handling objects. And
            their large ears allow them to radiate excess heat. Upper incisor teeth develop into tusks in African
            elephants and grow throughout their lifetime. There are two subspecies of African elephants—the Savanna (or
            bush) elephant and the Forest elephant. Savanna elephants are larger than forest elephants, and their tusks
            curve outwards. In addition to being smaller, forest elephants are darker and their tusks are straighter and
            point downward. There are also differences in the size and shape of the skull and skeleton between the two
            subspecies.
            Forest elephants, a distinct subspecies of African elephants, are uniquely adapted to the forest habitat of
            the Congo Basin, but are in sharp decline due to poaching for the international ivory trade. It is estimated
            that probably one quarter to one third of the total African elephant population is made up of forest
            elephants.</h4>

        <h3>Asian Elephants</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>The Asian elephant is the largest land mammal on the Asian continent. They inhabit dry to wet forest and
            grassland habitats in 13 range countries spanning South and Southeast Asia. While they have preferred forage
            plants, Asian elephants have adapted to surviving on resources that vary based on the area.
            Asian elephants are extremely sociable, forming groups of six to seven related females that are led by the
            oldest female, the matriarch. Like African elephants, these groups occasionally join others to form larger
            herds, although these associations are relatively short-lived. In Asia, elephant herd sizes are
            significantly smaller than those of savannah elephants in Africa.
            More than two-thirds of an elephant's day may be spent feeding on grasses, but it also eats large amounts of
            tree bark, roots, leaves, and small stems. Cultivated crops such as bananas, rice, and sugarcane are
            favorite foods. Elephants are always close to a source of fresh water because they need to drink at least
            once a day.</h4>

        <h4>Like their modern relatives, mammoths were quite large. The largest known species reached heights in the
            region of 4 m (13.1 ft) at the shoulder and weights of up to 8 tonnes (8.8 short tons), while exceptionally
            large males may have exceeded 12 tonnes (13.2 short tons). However, most species of mammoth were only about
            as large as a modern Asian elephant (which are about 2.5 m to 3 m high at the shoulder, and rarely exceeding
            5 tonnes). Both sexes bore tusks. A first, small set appeared at about the age of six months, and these were
            replaced at about 18 months by the permanent set. Growth of the permanent set was at a rate of about 2.5 to
            15.2 cm (1 to 6 in) per year.


            Size of various mammoth species compared with a human
            Based on studies of their close relatives, the modern elephants, mammoths probably had a gestation period of
            22 months, resulting in a single calf being born. Their social structure was probably the same as that of
            African and Asian elephants, with females living in herds headed by a matriarch, whilst bulls lived solitary
            lives or formed loose groups after sexual maturity.

            Scientists discovered and studied the remains of a mammoth calf, and found that fat greatly influenced its
            form, and enabled it to store large amounts of nutrients necessary for survival in temperatures as low as
            −50 °C (−58 °F).[19] The fat also allowed the mammoths to increase their muscle mass, allowing the mammoths
            to fight against enemies and live longer.</h4>
